\section{Features}
Features form the foundation of the scheduler. Features can take many forms, but most commonly they are HEALpixel maps that describe the current state of the sky and telescope or progress of the telescope. Some example features include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{A map of the number of completed observations}
    \item{A map of the desired number of observations at each point in the sky}
    \item{The currently loaded filter}
    \item{The currently observable HEALpixels}
\end{itemize}
Example feature maps are show in Figure~\ref{features}

\end{figure}


\section{Basis Functions}

\caption{The basis functions for the simulation. Left shows how the number of observations made is combined with the goal map to generate a basis function that prioritizes under-observed regions and penalizes over-observed areas. Right shows the depth basis function, which is the unmodified depth feature.\label{basis_funcs}}
\end{figure}


\section{Reward and Decision Functions}

The final reward function (also commonly called a "cost function") is calculated as a linear combination of the basis functions. The free parameters of the scheduler are thus the weights assigned to each basis function.

\section{Performance Function and Optimization}

\section{Discussion}
In the sims\_featureScheduler package, we have implemented features and basis functions as python classes. We have then added a survey class which takes a list of basis functions and weights to compute a reward function. Each filter can then be it's own survey instantiation.

Some advantages of a feature-based scheduler:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Object oriented nature of the code makes it possible to include other arbitrary schedulers (e.g., pre-scheduled deep drilling field observations).}
    \item{Easy to develop and debug new observing strategies as all the inputs to the reward function can be easily accessed and visualized.}
    \item{High spatial resolution features make it possible to easily include dithering options on the scheduling algorithm.}
    \item{By using high spatial resolution, the feature-based scheduler can incorporate any arbitrary camera geometry, such as as single raft commissioning camera.}
    \item{HEALpixel based features make it easy to compute the cost function efficiently with numpy}
    \item{We can queue multiple observations at a time, thus we do not need to compute the reward function after each  observation.}
    \item{All our data structures are picklable, so we can use python multiproccessing to get a factor of 6 speedup computing reward functions by running each survey on it's own processor.}
\end{itemize}
